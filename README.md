ChessCorPy
====================
A simple web-based correspondence chess application written in Python+Flask.

This was made just to get familliar with Flask and Python as a back-end web development platform. 
Thus, I spent very little time on the front-end and it's pretty ugly.

Although this does not have near the number of features of professional chess apps, it has all the basics such as:

* Account creation system
* Creating and viewing public and private challenge requests
* Chat system
* Automatic email notifications when a move is played
* Input validation, error handling, and basic security
* And of course, a playable chess board!

View a live demo [here!](https://chesscorpy.herokuapp.com/) (does not currently work on mobile unfortunately)

Requirements
============
* Python 3+
* All requirements in requirements.txt

Installation
============
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Run
===
In the folder where the chesscorpy package is located:

```
export FLASK_APP=chesscorpy
flask run
```

Configure
=========
* In app.py, modify email configuration if you wish to have emails sent out to players.
* Modify database.py if you wish to use a database platform other than SQLite.

Testing
=======
Unit tests are kept in the /tests folder and can be run with pytest.

This was my first time implementing tests so I never got around to implementing
any that require mock data but I will work on that next time.

Contribution
============
Anyone is free to contribute. If a front-end developer wants to take a stab at making it less ugly and functional on mobile I'd greatly appreciate it!
